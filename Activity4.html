			<p id = "posted_paragraph">Sir Arturo Caronongan!! Our class was mainly asynchronous so we learned at our own pace. He gave lots of practice quizzes and all his deadlines are usually due before the term ends so he is very lenient. If you do have synchronous sesh its usually him teaching you how to solve a certain prog problem (it usually shows up sa exam so its super useful). Super kind and highly recommend :></p>
