How to run the program:

1.) Unzip the file in you local computer, open command prompt, and enter "node index.js" in the same directory as this README

2.) Go to localhost:3000 on a browser, where index.hbs will be rendered, giving you either the choice to log-in or sign-up.

3.) If you want to create a new account, click the "Sign-up for an account" button to go to the sign-up page, and the page you will be directed to will require you to give your ID number (which must not exist in the database yet), your first and last name, your preferred password (and a requirement to re-type that password), and your e-mail. Upon filling up all the fields, click the submit button and then log-in using that account.

4.) Once logged in, you will be directed to the home page, where you will see a button for the Announcements Page, Discussions Page, Professors Page, Profile Page, About Page, and Log-out.

5a.) If you choose to click the Announcements, Discussions, or Professors button, you will be redirected to their respective pages, where you will be presented a table of all the posts' names, poster, date of creation, and number of replies of that category. The Announcements Page is for announcements from anything regarding exams to students' birthday parties, the Discussion Page is just for general discussions, and the Professors page is for discussing professors (although no bashing is allowed). You are allowed to make posts if you want by clicking the Create New Post button (and all fields must be filled). You may also sort the posts by their date or title. You can also search for specific posts in the search bar so long as the keyword being searched is in the title of the post, and it will show all posts if the search bar is empty when "Search" is clicked. And you may see the full post and its respective comments by clicking on the title of the post which will send you to the Post Page.

5b.)In the Post Page, you will see the content of the post you clicked and all its comments. You may choose to create a comment yourself in the text box. There are edit and delete buttons for the post and the comments but they will only work if you are the one that posted the post/comments, otherwise, the website will reload and show an error message. you can also search for comments that have a specific substring, and all comments will be showed if the search bar is empty when "Search" is clicked.

6.) You can see your profile when you click the "Profile" button in the Home page, and you can also see others' profiles when you click their names in any of the posts or comments. In the profile page, you can see the student's name, ID number, and posts created (which you can click to send you to the appropriate post). There are sort and search options for the posts which work like the other ones. There are edit buttons for the profile picture and profile in general, as well as a delete profile button, but they will only work if oyu are the owner of the profile, otherwise error messages will be shown. For the edit and delete profile buttons, if you are the owner, then you will have to enter your password and then confirm it in order to make any changes. If you choose to delete your profile, you will be logged out and have your profile and all your posts and comments subsequently deleted.

7.) If you click the "About" page you will see the creators of this website and the installed npm packages used.

8.) Click the "Log out" button to log out.
